<h2>Staying On-Island</h2>

<p>There are no hotel rooms for rent on Fishers Island. However, multiple
families in the community have graciously opened their homes to those wishing
to stay on the island. Please let us know as soon as possible so we can pair
you with a host family.</p>

<p>Please plan on taking the
<a href="http://www.fiferry.com" target="_blank">Fishers Island Ferry</a> to
the island. Guests staying on the island are encouraged to carpool to reduce
congestion on the ferry. If you are taking a car on the ferry, please make a
reservation for both your arrival and Sunday departure. Cars must be at the
dock at least 25 minutes before the scheduled departure time or your
reservation will be lost.</p>

<p>Cars not coming to the island can park at the
<a href="http://www.newlondonparking.com" target="_blank">Water Street Garage</a>,
just across the street from the ferry dock.</p>

<h2>Off-Island Accommodations</h2>

<p>We have reserved a block of rooms at the
<a href="http://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/new-london/hfdnl/hoteldetail" target="_blank">Holiday Inn</a>
in New London, CT. Please use reservation code ‟GBW.” Rooms are
$159 Friday night and $169 Saturday night.</p>

<p>The hotel is a short walk from the ferry dock. Please walk on to the Fishers
Island Ferry to the island on Saturday. Since the last ferry will leave before
the reception is over, we have arranged for the Popeye, a small charter boat,
to take guests from the island back to New London. Transportation while on the
island will be provided.</p>
