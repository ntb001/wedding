<h1>About Fishers Island</h1>

<p>We are excited to have our wedding on Fishers Island, the place we
are happy to call our home. Fishers Island is about eight miles long
and, though part of New York, is only accessible from Connecticut.</p>

<p>The primary method to get to the island is via the
<a href="http://www.fiferry.com" target="_blank">Fishers Island Ferry</a>,
which travels between New London, CT and Silver Eel Pond on the west end
of the island.  The ferry transports vehicles and walk-on passengers. We
will also charter the
<a href="http://www.popeyecharters.webs.com" target="_blank">Popeye</a>
to cary walk-ons from Noank to the "Mobil Dock" the morning of the
wedding and back again the same evening.</p>

<p>The weather on a small island can be unpredictable. In the winter, it
is equally likely for school to be canceled from high winds and rough
seas than from snow. Rain can break out at any time, even in clear
skies. In the summer, the humidity can make it rain indoors during the
day and the cool sea breeze quickly saps any warmth from the sun after
it sets. </p>

<p>The island is a small, tight-knit community where everybody knows
your name (or why you&rsquo;re visiting). We&rsquo;re extremely grateful
to our host families,
<a href="http://www.stjohnsfi.org" target="_blank">St. John&rsquo;s Church</a>,
the
<a href="http://www.hayharborclub.com" target="_blank">Hay Harbor Club</a>
and the
<a href="http://fishersisland.net/category/community-center" target="_blank">Community Center Caf&eacute;</a>
for accommodating us. Check out
<a href="http://fishersisland.net" target="_blank">FishersIsland.net</a>
to see what we&rsquo;re up to here on the island.</p>
